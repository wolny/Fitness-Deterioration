\label{FitnessDeterioration}

TODO: description of the deterioration process,
not very computationally intensive,
easy to improve in subsequent runs,
interpolation accuracy is not crucial, what is most important is to
minimize the probability of finding the basins of attraction which was
previously explored,
use knowledge from clusteres;

 
\section{Sequential niching}

basic description of deterioration: 
when used, what approach,
connection with clustering algorithms,
advantages of OPTICS algorithm (improving deterioration by extracting clusters
wiht different densities, cheapness)

\section{Basic Scheme}

detailed description of basic scheme deterioration

\section{Adaptive Scheme}

detailed description of adaptive scheme deterioration
