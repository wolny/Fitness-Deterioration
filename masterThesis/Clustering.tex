TODO: cluster extension, set detection (specyfying set of individuals using
small set of parameters, e.g center and radius),
we make an assumption that clusters are good apprximation of basins of

clustering metrics,
clustering as an effective stop criterion (definition of the stop criterion,
problems)

general description, optics ordering, extracting clusters, random samples,
clustering, diagrams, reachability plots,
why optics is good for further deterioration (describe in the next chapter)
