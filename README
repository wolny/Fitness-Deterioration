Program performs global optimization for a given problem.
Global optimization algorithm is controled by a hybrid approach
called 'Sequantial Niching'. It performs several runs of specified
EA. After each run it the algorithm alters fitness function in a way
that prevents exploration of optimas founded in previous runs.

Program writes the results in 'diagrams' catalog:
* cluster's members are stored in files of the name 'clusterN', where N is the cluster's number
* populations for each run are stored in files 'populationN', where N is the number of EA run
* fitness landscape before the algorithm start is stored in file 'originalFitnessLand'
* reachablity plot for OPTICS algorithm is stored in ''reachabilityPlot'
* fitness landscape after each run is stored in 'fintessLand_iterN' where N is the number of EA run
